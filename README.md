 <h1>AI-Powered 3D Human Pose Estimation for Fitness</h1>

## Project Description
This project focuses on building an AI-powered system that uses 3D human pose estimation to monitor and guide users during fitness exercises. By analyzing body movements through a camera, the system offers real-time posture correction, personalized workout plans, and progress tracking. It aims to improve exercise effectiveness and reduce the risk of injury by ensuring proper form without needing physical supervision.

## Problem
People often perform exercises with incorrect posture, which can lead to injuries. There is a need for an AI solution that assists users in maintaining correct form during workouts.

---

## Solution
An AI-based coach that uses pose estimation to detect human movements and provide real-time feedback to correct posture during exercise.

## Deep Learning Techniques Used
- **Deep Learning-Based Pose Estimation** (HRNet, MediaPipe, OpenPose) – for tracking 3D human posture.
- **Reinforcement Learning** (PPO, DDPG) – for enhancing form correction recommendations.
- **CNN + LSTM** – for motion sequence analysis and progress tracking.

---

## Unique Features
-  Real-Time Posture Correction with alerts for incorrect form  
-  AI-Based Personalized Workout Plans based on user progress  
-  Rehabilitation Tracking for post-injury mobility support  
-  Automated Reps & Workout Counter using camera input
